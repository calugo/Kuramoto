#Home of the Kuramoto-complexity project.


We now have codes which:
 * generate several topologies
 * generate an initial configuration
 * solve the system.
 * Soon to be added will be a script for *en masse*  production


The project so far can be seen [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/calugo/Kuramoto/blob/master/NOTES.ipynb)

You can download and play, there are some issues in the last figure which tell me
the method is perhaps not doing things well, I will chech this asap.
