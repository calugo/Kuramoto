#Home of the Kuramoto-complexity project.


We now have codes which:
 * generate several topologies
 * generate initial configurations
 * solve the system.
 * calculate frustration matrices and global F
 * Results visualisation
 * An easy copy/paste job creates script for *en masse*  production, but doesnt seem to be necessary to study the properties I am interested at the minute.

The project so far can be seen [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/calugo/Kuramoto/blob/master/NOTES.ipynb)

Download the notebooks and play! I have been recreating known results for repulsive oscillators which  tell me that the numerical method is fine.
